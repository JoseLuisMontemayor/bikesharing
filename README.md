# Bikesharing Analysis

### Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project is to create a visual interpretation of the results and details of the usage of bikes in NYC. The project of Citi bike is analyzed to see how that succesfull business model can be applied in the city of Des Moines. The tools of Tableau and Pandas DataFrame were used to develop the activity. 

### Results

As entering the link [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jose.luis.montemayor/viz/bikesharingChallenge_16585306337060/BikesharingAnalysis) we can find first the introduction information, in which we can see a map of the city of New York and the starting and ending locations of the trips the users make on the bikes. It is easy to compare the zones in which people usually start and finish their route. Then we have a gender breakdown of the users, in which we can see that males are the principal participants.

Then we can see the graph with the data of the checkout times for users:

We can see that most of the trip durations are less than 40 minutes, the trips made with the bikes are not that long, and it has to be taken into account with the new city Des Moines, maybe the distances are longer of nearer for the users, and it would be essential to see the placement of the city in contrast with NYC. 

We can see then the checkout times by gender:

We can see that the males and females have a similar trend on the graph, with a peak in 10 minutes and then it decreases. In part the unknown gender has a stable peak between 10 and 30 minutes and then it decreases the same as the other genders.
